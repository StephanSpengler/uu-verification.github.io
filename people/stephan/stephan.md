# Stephan Spengler
**PhD Student**

Since 2022, I am a PhD student at Uppsala University (Sweden). I work in algorithmic program verification, mostly with weak memory models. My supervisors are Parosh Aziz Abdulla and Mohamed Faouzi Atig.

Before coming to Uppsala, I got a Master's degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Kaiserslautern (Germany). My thesis was in the area of computational complexity theory.
